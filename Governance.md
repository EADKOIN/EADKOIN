## **2. EADWARIN System: Health, Finance, and Communication Integration**

### **Health and Ergonomics Integration**

**RSI Mitigation**  
EADWARIN monitors repetitive motions and long sedentary behaviors, providing real-time suggestions for breaks, posture adjustments, and ergonomic corrections.

```python
import time
import random

class RSIManager:
    def __init__(self, user_id):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.last_activity_time = time.time()

    def detect_rsi(self):
        current_time = time.time()
        if current_time - self.last_activity_time > 3600:  # 1 hour
            self.send_reminder()

    def send_reminder(self):
        print(f"Reminder for user {self.user_id}: Take a break and adjust your posture!")

user_rsi = RSIManager(user_id=1)
while True:
    user_rsi.detect_rsi()
    time.sleep(random.uniform(5, 20))
```

**RFI Protection**  
EADWARIN ensures users are protected from harmful electromagnetic interference by monitoring emission levels and providing warnings when necessary.

```python
class RFIManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.emission_level = 0.0

    def monitor_emissions(self):
        self.emission_level = random.uniform(0, 1)
        if self.emission_level > 0.8:
            self.send_alert()

    def send_alert(self):
        print("Warning: High electromagnetic interference detected!")

rfi_manager = RFIManager()
while True:
    rfi_manager.monitor_emissions()
    time.sleep(5)
```

### **EADWARIN Economy**

EADWARIN uses **EADKOIN** and **EAD BUCKS** to power a self-regulating economic model.

```python
class EADKoinEconomy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 1000.0

    def transaction(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Transaction successful! Remaining balance: {self.balance} EADKoin")

        self.sender_key = sender_key
        self.receiver_key = receiver_key
        self.translator = Translator()

    def translate_message(self, message, target_lang):
        translated = self.translator.translate(message, dest=target_lang)
        return translated.text

    def send_message(self, message, target_lang):
        print(f"Sending message: {message}")
        translated_message = self.translate_message(message, target_lang)
        print(f"Translated message: {translated_message}")
        self.send_encrypted_message(translated_message)

    def send_encrypted_message(self, message):
        encrypted_message = message[::-1]
        print(f"Encrypted message: {encrypted_message}")

messaging = SecureMessaging(sender_key="user_key_1", receiver_key="user_key_2")
message = "Hello! I hope you're doing well."
messaging.send_message(message, target_lang='es')
```

### **Secure and Decentralized Messaging**

EADWARIN uses blockchain encryption to secure messages and ensure privacy.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class BlockchainEncryption:
    def __init__(self):
        self.key = Fernet.generate_key()
        self.cipher_suite = Fernet(self.key)

    def encrypt_message(self, message):
        encrypted_message = self.cipher_suite.encrypt(message.encode())
        return encrypted_message

    def decrypt_message(self, encrypted_message):
        decrypted_message = self.cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_message).decode()
        return decrypted_message

blockchain_system = BlockchainEncryption()
message = "Secure message from EADWARIN!"
encrypted = blockchain_system.encrypt_message(message

)
print(f"Encrypted message: {encrypted}")
decrypted = blockchain_system.decrypt_message(encrypted)
print(f"Decrypted message: {decrypted}")
```
