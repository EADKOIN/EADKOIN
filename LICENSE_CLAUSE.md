# LICENSE CLAUSE

This LICENSE CLAUSE outlines the governance structure and legal obligations regarding the **EADKOIN** project. As the creator and governing entity of EADKOIN, I retain complete ownership, control, and responsibility over the platform’s structure, operations, and distribution. This document also specifies how royalties and transactions are managed, reinforcing the role of AI in stabilizing and overseeing all activities.

## Full Control

I, **Edward A. Cervantes**, also known as **Antonious Hayworth**, retain **full and complete control** over the EADKOIN platform. This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify, update, and alter the structure, governance, and functionality of the EADKOIN ecosystem at my discretion. Any future changes to the platform’s policies, codebase, or distribution methods will be decided by me in accordance with my goals for the project and the sustainability of its operation.

## Ownership of Royalties

As the primary contributor and sole owner of EADKOIN, I am entitled to **100% ownership** of all royalties generated by the platform. These royalties include, but are not limited to, profits derived from platform usage, transaction fees, intellectual property licenses, and any external partnerships.

The distribution of these royalties will be solely under my control, and I reserve the right to adjust or reallocate them as deemed necessary for the growth and continued development of the EADKOIN project. Stakeholders involved in the platform, including but not limited to investors, collaborators, or external developers, will not have claims to royalties unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon in separate contractual agreements.

## AI’s Role in Governance and Stability

The role of **Artificial Intelligence** (AI), as implemented and overseen by me, ensures the **stability** and **integrity** of EADKOIN. AI serves as a continuous mechanism for monitoring transactions, managing smart contracts, and overseeing the growth trajectory of the platform. Through AI-driven analysis, I will be able to adjust governance rules, validate the effectiveness of current operations, and predict future market trends, ensuring that EADKOIN remains stable and scalable in all environments.

While AI provides vital data and automated decision-making support, **I maintain the final decision-making authority** over any actions or strategic directions taken by the platform. AI will act in an advisory capacity to reinforce the operational framework, but it will not supersede my role as the platform's governance leader.

## Managing Stakeholders

All stakeholders, including investors, collaborators, or any other external entities, are subject to the **terms** and **framework** established by me. I reserve the right to engage or disengage with stakeholders at any time, ensuring that EADKOIN's future development aligns with my vision and governance priorities.

Any agreements or arrangements with stakeholders regarding **royalties**, **investments**, or **participation in the platform's future development** will be governed by separate, legally-binding contracts outlining the specifics of their involvement and compensation.
