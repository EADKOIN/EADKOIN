Code of Conduct for EADKOIN
We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community for all contributors. By participating in the EADKOIN project, you agree to uphold the following principles and treat others with respect.

1. Respectful Communication
Be respectful and considerate when communicating with others, including contributors, community members, and leadership.
Avoid harmful, offensive, or exclusionary language or behavior that may alienate others or undermine the project's goals.
2. Collaboration & Inclusion
We value diverse perspectives, ideas, and contributions from all community members. We believe that a variety of viewpoints leads to stronger innovation and better solutions.
Collaborate with others in a supportive and constructive manner. Encourage open, thoughtful discussion and embrace the opportunity to learn from one another.
3. Zero Tolerance for Harassment
Harassment of any kind—whether verbal, physical, or virtual—is strictly prohibited. This includes but is not limited to offensive language, discriminatory remarks, exclusionary behavior, and any form of personal attack.
Any such behavior will not be tolerated, and we are committed to addressing it promptly to maintain a safe and respectful environment.
4. Professional Conduct
Always act in a professional and courteous manner when interacting with the community or project leadership. Your behavior reflects not only on you but also on the EADKOIN project as a whole.
Ensure that all communications and contributions are made with consideration for the impact they may have on others in the community.
5. Compliance
Ensure that your contributions, including code, documentation, and any other materials, comply with all legal requirements, intellectual property rights, and relevant regulations.
You are responsible for ensuring that your contributions are original and do not infringe upon the rights of others.
Failure to adhere to these principles may result in a warning or, in extreme cases, a ban from the project.
