Contributing to EADKOIN
We appreciate your interest in contributing to the EADKOIN project! This guide outlines the rules and guidelines for contributing, ensuring the continued stability and value of EADKOIN, particularly around the core value mechanism, judicial frameworks, and royalty structures.

Please read through this document carefully before contributing to ensure your contributions align with our goals and standards.

Core Principles
1. Core Value Mechanism
Unmodifiable: Contributions cannot alter the fundamental algorithms driving the value of EADKOIN or the core mechanisms that dictate the growth, distribution, and stability of the cryptocurrency. These mechanisms have been carefully crafted to ensure consistent value growth and transparency.
Judicial & Royalty Structures: Contributions must not interfere with the judicial oversight and royalty distribution models we have established. This includes both the functionality of the algorithms and how royalties are assigned and distributed to stakeholders, including judicial officials involved in the governance.
2. Maintaining Stability
Inflation Control: Any proposed changes that may impact inflation control mechanisms or EADKOIN's growth rate must be carefully evaluated and reviewed to ensure they align with the project's long-term goals of stability and economic equity.
Judicial Oversight: EADKOIN has integrated judicial officials, particularly from the 8th Judicial District Court of Clark County, NV, for governance purposes. Any proposed alterations to the governance structure must be vetted and approved through the appropriate legal channels.
How to Contribute
1. Proposing Changes or Features
Opening an Issue: If you have an idea for a change or feature, start by opening an issue in the GitHub repository. Ensure your proposal aligns with our core principles and explain how the change will benefit the project without affecting its fundamental structure.
Pull Requests: Once your idea has been discussed and approved, you can submit a pull request (PR). Be sure to follow the coding and documentation standards laid out in the project. Your PR will be reviewed, and you may be asked to make revisions before it is merged.
2. How Contributions Will Be Recognized
Royalties & Incentives: Contributors who add valuable features or improvements may be eligible for royalties. The specific amount and terms will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the project leadership.
Attribution: All accepted contributions will be attributed to the contributor in the project's documentation and release notes. We acknowledge your work and give credit where credit is due.
Incentive Models: Contributors may also receive other forms of recognition, such as EDDIE BUCKS, special access to new features, or priority in decision-making processes for future updates.
